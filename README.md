# CompVis_ObjDetection-DistanceRanging
Originally made for Durham University's Department of Computer Science's course Software, Systems & Applications under the sub-module Computer Vision, as part of the coursework in 2018/2019.

This project aims to "develop an object detection system that correctly detects one or more types of dynamic objects within the scene in-front of the vehicle and estimates the range (distance in metres) to those objects.", given a set of stereo images taken from a moving car in real world traffic.
