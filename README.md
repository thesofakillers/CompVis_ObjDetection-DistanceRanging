# CompVis_ObjDetection-DistanceRanging
Originally made for Durham University's Department of Computer Science's course *Software, Systems & Applications* under the sub-module *Computer Vision*, as part of the coursework in 2018/2019.

This project aims to "develop an object detection system that correctly detects one or more types of dynamic objects within the scene in-front of the vehicle and estimates the range (distance in metres) to those objects.", given a set of stereo images taken from a moving car in real world traffic.

A few directories/files are not committed to this repository due to their unwieldy sizes, their availability on the web, or uncertainty with regards to their proprietary status. These include the training data, which is a cut-down copy of the original INRIA pedestrain data set from http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/human/. The stereo images themselves, which, due to their large amount, occupy a large amount of space, are also part of the uncommitted files.
